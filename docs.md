# Membrane-CDT System Overview

## ðŸª™ CDT: The Stable Token

CDT is a decentralized, floating-peg debt token designed to support scalable, collateral-backed growth.

- **Floating Peg**: CDT is not soft-pegged to USD, enabling organic price discovery and dynamic utility.
- **Growth-Optimized**: Minting costs are intentionally low to encourage adoption and liquidity expansion.
- **Core Collaterals Supported**:
  - Major assets: `BTC`, `ETH`, `TIA`, `SOL`, `ATOM`, `OSMO`, `USDC`, `USDT`
  - Liquid Staking Tokens (LSTs) for the above assets

---

## ðŸ§ª Minting Mechanism

CDT minting uses an autonomous, risk-aware system with bundled collateral types and a liquidation recovery path.

- **Collateral Bundles**: Users mint CDT by depositing approved asset bundles.
- **Volatility-Aware Risk Management**: Dynamic LTVs and interest rates based on asset risk profiles.
- **Liquidation Recovery System**:
  - Collateral is sold to repay debt
  - Designed to protect users from extreme slippage during liquidations
- **Peg-Aware Interest Rates**: Rates adjust dynamically based on CDTâ€™s market performance and peg conditions

---

## ðŸ§  Isolated Collateral Markets

Each collateral type has its own isolated CDT debt market with programmable automation.

- **Intent System**:
  - Supports strategies like **looping**, **stop-loss/take-profit**, and **arbitrage**
- **Risk Tranching**: CDT lenders can opt into senior/junior tranches depending on risk appetite
- **Debt Token**: All loans use CDT as the borrowed asset

## ðŸ’¥ Liquidation Bids System

All protocol liquidations flow through this unified bidding mechanism.

- **Bid Options**:
  - **Global (Omni) Bids**: One pool for all collateral types
  - **Individual Bids**: Separate bids per vault
- **Bid Vaults**: Users can deposit capital into vaults to automatically compound their bids over time

- **Contract Control**:
  - Governance owns the major protocol contracts
- **POL Holdings**:
  - 1% of MBRN is held as protocol-owned liquidity (POL) on Osmosis
